BinSourcerer
============

BinSourcerer is an assembly to source code matching framework written in Python. The main 
purpose of BinSourcerer is to recreate the functionalities that RE-Google provided, until 
the Google Code Search API was discontinued. This plugin can be used for code search 
(GitHub, Ohloh, etc.) and function tagging. It generates a disassembly feature file that 
can be used in various binary analyzes. Moreover, the framework functionalities are 
easily expandable.
